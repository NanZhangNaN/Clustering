# Clustering
CLUSTERING ON DIFFERENT DATASETS

1. Evaluated the K-Means Algorithm, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN Algorithm on a specific dataset using Python
and SciKitLearn library 
2. Summarized that DBSCAN Algorithm worked best on the dataset with highest With-in-Sum-of Squares (WSS) and lowest
Between-Sum-of Squares (BSS)
