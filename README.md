# Clustering
CLUSTERING ON DIFFERENT DATASETS

● Evaluated the K-Means Algorithm, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN Algorithm on a specific dataset using Python
and SciKitLearn library <br \>
● Summarized that DBSCAN Algorithm worked best on the dataset with highest With-in-Sum-of Squares (WSS) and lowest
Between-Sum-of Squares (BSS)
